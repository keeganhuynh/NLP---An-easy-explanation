# NLP An easy explanation
1. Main task in NLP are:
   a. Speech Recognition
   b. Word Sense Disambiguation
   c. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
   d. Sentiment Analysis
2. Types of AI Chatbots
   a. Scripted Chatbots:
   Scripted ai chatbots are chatbots that operate based on pre-determined scripts stored in their library. When a user inputs a query, or in the case of chatbots with speech-to-text conversion modules, speaks a query, the chatbot replies according to the predefined script within its library. One drawback of this type of chatbot is that users must structure their queries very precisely, using comma-separated commands or other regular expressions, to facilitate string analysis and understanding. This makes it challenging to integrate these chatbots with NLP-supported speech-to-text conversion modules, and they are rarely suitable for conversion into intelligent virtual assistants.
